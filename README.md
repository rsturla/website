# Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a slightly customized [theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome).


## Development

To run the website locally, you will need to install Hugo. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Once you have installed Hugo, you can run the website locally by running the following command:

```bash
$ hugo server
```


## Deployment

This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is automatically deployed whenever a commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
